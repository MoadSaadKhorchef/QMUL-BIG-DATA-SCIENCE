# VGG-and-ResNet-Architectures
This is an implementation of a number of famous deep learning architectures from scratch using PyTorch. VGG13 and VGG16, as well as ResNet performances are investigated using CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets. 
The code was written so that network depth is easily customisable.
